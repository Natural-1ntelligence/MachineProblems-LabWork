If you feel extremely overburdened by your daily share of activities, this question might feel like it makes no sense. You might say: “Well, I have a lot of things I’m pursuing right now. A series of goals. A long sequence of unfinished projects. A lot of commitments and deadlines. What’s the fun in adding philosophy in this long list? Once I have everything sorted out, I can always have the luxury of delineating the broader contours of life philosophy.”
But, my friend, there are others who have absolutely no problem answering this with conviction — This is what I want. Everything becomes a bit clearer when you bring that level of clarity in your goal. It’s not what you want to get done today, tomorrow or even this year. It’s what you’re trying to get out of life. What you are doing now, is it helpful in making it a reality? If not then, what’s stopping you from making amends?
